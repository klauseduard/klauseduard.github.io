## Projects

### [Estonian Parliament Election Simulator](https://klauseduard.github.io/eesti-valimissimulaator/)
A simulation tool for Estonian parliamentary elections that demonstrates mandate distribution based on party ratings. The simulator uses actual candidate lists from the 2023 elections and implements the current election law's distribution rules.

### [Estonian Scrabble](https://klauseduard.github.io/estonian-scrabble/)
A Python-based implementation of the classic Scrabble board game, specifically designed for the Estonian language. Features include Estonian alphabet support (õ, ä, ö, ü, š, ž), Estonian wordlist validation, and a modern graphical user interface.

### [Concept Explainer](https://klauseduard.github.io/concept-explainer/)
A coding experiment from the early days of the LLM boom (2023) that uses simulated conversations to explain concepts.
Updated in February 2025 with local LLM support.
